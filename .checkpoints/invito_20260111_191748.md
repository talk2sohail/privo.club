# Invito Project Work Summary - 2026-01-11

## Overview
Invito is a Next.js-based event management platform that facilitates group interactions (Circles), invitations (Invites), and real-time event updates (Feed).

## Current Status & Features
- **Circle Management**: Users can create circles, manage memberships (Owner, Admin, Member), and link invitations to specific circles.
- **Invitation System**: Comprehensive invite model with details for title, description, location, and event date.
- **RSVP Tracking**: Guests can RSVP with status (YES, NO, MAYBE), guest count, dietary requirements, and notes.
- **Event Feed**: Real-time event updates and chat items within each invitation's feed.
- **Media Sharing**: Users can upload images and videos associated with invitations.
- **Authentication**: Secure authentication handled via NextAuth.js.
- **Data Persistence**: Robust PostgreSQL database schema managed by Prisma.

## Recent Work
- Codebase analysis confirmed implementation of server actions for all core business logic.
- Project structure validated for Next.js App Router (version 15+ based on `package.json` and `next.config.ts`).
- Standard project documentation initialized: `GEMINI.md` and `LEARNINGS.gemini.md`.

## Analysis
The codebase is well-structured, utilizing modern Next.js patterns. The use of server actions (`src/app/actions`) indicates a move towards the latest RSC (React Server Components) paradigm. The database schema is comprehensive, covering all necessary relationships for a social event platform.

One notable point is the recent troubleshooting for the app's location, ensuring it's running correctly in its current directory.
