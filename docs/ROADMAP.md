# Privo.club Feature Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the plan to transform Privo.club into a feature-rich, visually stunning event management platform.

## Phase 1: The "Premium Invite" Experience (Visual & Functional Core)
**Goal:** Make every invite feel special and provide all necessary utility for guests.

### 1.1 Rich Media & Aesthetics
- **Cover Images:** Allow users to upload cover photos or select from a gallery (Unsplash integration).
- **Rich Text Descriptions:** Upgrade description input to support bolding, lists, and links (Markdown or RTE).
- **Theme Selection:** Allow basic color theming per invite (e.g., "Party Mode", "Business", "Casual").

### 1.2 Enhanced Logistics
- **Interactive Maps:** specific location pinning (Google Maps or Mapbox/Leaflet integration) instead of just text.
- **Calendar Integration:** "Add to Calendar" button (Google, Apple, Outlook) and .ics file export.
- **Timezone Awareness:** Explicit timezone support for all events.

## Phase 2: Social Engagement (The "Circle" Life)
**Goal:** Keep users engaged before, during, and after the event.

### 2.1 Interaction
- **Discussion Board / Comments:** Allow users to ask questions or chat on the invite page.
- **Polls:** Create polls for "Best Date", "Food Preference", or "Location Voting".
- **Reactions:** Emoji reactions on invtes and feed items.

### 2.2 Shared Memories
- **Collaborative Gallery:** Enhanced media feed where all guests can upload photos/videos after the event.
- **"Live" Mode:** A special view for the day of the event (highlighting location, wifi code, etc.).

**Goal:** Give hosts powerful tools to manage their events.

### 3.1 Advanced RSVP
- **Guest Limits & Waitlists:** Set max attendees and automatic waitlist handling.
- **Plus-Ones:** Toggle to allow/disallow guests bringing +1s.
- **Custom Questions:** Ask guests specific questions (Dietary, Song Request) during RSVP.

### 3.2 Discovery & Sharing
- **Social Previews (OG Tags):** Dynamic Open Graph images so links look beautiful on WhatsApp/iMessage.

### 4.1 Notifications

### 4.2 Accessibility & Mobile
